    print(f"Hi everyone, my name is Tanuj Ranjith. Personally I love robotics, coding, music, badminton, cooking, video games, movie watching, and going out with friends. For robotics I am part of VEX Robotics team 91C for the past 4 years and was with a different team for 2 years and before that I did FLL for 3 years, so i've been doing robotics my whole life and have built many robotics projects on the side. In my freetime i love to code projects and build apps to solve my personal issues. I also love to cook and see how different spices interact with each other to develop new flavors and reactions. Look forward to learning along side you guys!")
